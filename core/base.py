class BasePolicy(ABC, nn.Module):
    """The base class for any RL policy.

    Tianshou aims to modularizing RL algorithms. It comes into several classes of
    policies in Tianshou. All of the policy classes must inherit
    :class:`~tianshou.policy.BasePolicy`.

    A policy class typically has the following parts:

    * :meth:`~tianshou.policy.BasePolicy.__init__`: initialize the policy, including \
        coping the target network and so on;
    * :meth:`~tianshou.policy.BasePolicy.forward`: compute action with given \
        observation;
    * :meth:`~tianshou.policy.BasePolicy.process_fn`: pre-process data from the \
        replay buffer (this function can interact with replay buffer);
    * :meth:`~tianshou.policy.BasePolicy.learn`: update policy with a given batch of \
        data.
    * :meth:`~tianshou.policy.BasePolicy.post_process_fn`: update the replay buffer \
        from the learning process (e.g., prioritized replay buffer needs to update \
        the weight);
    * :meth:`~tianshou.policy.BasePolicy.update`: the main interface for training, \
        i.e., `process_fn -> learn -> post_process_fn`.

    Most of the policy needs a neural network to predict the action and an
    optimizer to optimize the policy. The rules of self-defined networks are:

    1. Input: observation "obs" (may be a ``numpy.ndarray``, a ``torch.Tensor``, a \
    dict or any others), hidden state "state" (for RNN usage), and other information \
    "info" provided by the environment.
    2. Output: some "logits", the next hidden state "state", and the intermediate \
    result during policy forwarding procedure "policy". The "logits" could be a tuple \
    instead of a ``torch.Tensor``. It depends on how the policy process the network \
    output. For example, in PPO, the return of the network might be \
    ``(mu, sigma), state`` for Gaussian policy. The "policy" can be a Batch of \
    torch.Tensor or other things, which will be stored in the replay buffer, and can \
    be accessed in the policy update process (e.g. in "policy.learn()", the \
    "batch.policy" is what you need).

    Since :class:`~tianshou.policy.BasePolicy` inherits ``torch.nn.Module``, you can
    use :class:`~tianshou.policy.BasePolicy` almost the same as ``torch.nn.Module``,
    for instance, loading and saving the model:
    ::

        torch.save(policy.state_dict(), "policy.pth")
        policy.load_state_dict(torch.load("policy.pth"))
